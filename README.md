# Project 'Build Your Own Shell' for learning C++
I originally found out about codecrafters.io from a video on youtube by CoreDumped.
from there, since I've been wanting to learn C/C++ for awhile, I decided to use
this project to learn C++ and build a shell. 

I have completed the first section and am going to begin working on the project
extensions soon! I am also making sure to have good documentation of things, but
this is a self lead project so their is not any string rules I am currently following.
